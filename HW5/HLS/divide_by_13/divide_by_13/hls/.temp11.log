ERROR [HLS SIM]: an hls::stream is read while empty, which may result in RTL simulation hanging.
If this is not expected, execute C simulation in debug mode in the GUI and examine the source code location of the blocked hls::stream::read() call to debug.
If this is expected, add -DALLOW_EMPTY_HLS_STREAM_READS to -cflags to turn this error into a warning and allow empty hls::stream reads to return the default value for the data type.
